## Course Description

This course aims to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of statistical methods and their applications in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences.  We will explore topics such as descriptive statistics, probability, and time series analysis.  Emphasizing both theoretical foundations and practical skills, the course integrates lectures with interactive labs.

### Homework
There will be homework assignments most weeks.  These will be submitted as Jupyter Notebooks.  More instructions will follow.

### Participation
I will track in-class participation over the course of the semester.  This includes attending lectures, raising your hand to ask questions or to answer questions posed to the class, and meaningfully engaging with your classmates during breakout segments of class.

### Midterms
There will be two midterms, the first covering material from roughly the first half of the semester, and the second covering roughly the second half (and only the second half; it is not cumulative).  These will be open-note but in-person, pencil-and-paper *only* exams (no calculators, computers, phones, etc.).

### Final project

In the final project, you will apply some of the statistical methods learned throughout the course to a real-world problem in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences of your choosing.  In consultation with the professor, you will select a topic of interest; then you will conduct data analysis, right a final report, and present your findings to the class.  The grade will be based on the final report and presentation, both equally weighted.

## Academic Integrity

### General
Academic integrity is a fundamental value of CCNY, and adherence to its principles is vital for a meaningful learning experience. Students are expected to complete all assignments, exams, and projects with honesty and integrity. Plagiarism, cheating, or other forms of academic misconduct will not be tolerated. Violations will result in disciplinary actions, which may include a failing grade for the assignment, failure of the course, or further institutional penalties. It is the responsibility of each student to be familiar with and uphold the Academic Integrity Policies of CCNY ([here](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/academicaffairs/academic-integrityacademic-standards)) and of the City University of New York ([here](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/policies-resources/academic-integrity-policy/)). Collaboration and discussion with peers are encouraged within the bounds defined by the instructor, but all submitted work must be the student's original effort.

### ChatGPT and other AI tools

`With great power comes great responsibility.` --Spider Man(?)

(Just in case you're not familiar, [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool (specifically, a "large language model" or LLM) that is extremely powerful.  In response to questions written in plain english, it can for example write whole essays, generate snippets of computer code, or explain technical concepts.  There are other similar LLM tools available as well, but for brevity I'll use ChatGPT as shorthand for any such tool.)

We live now firmly in the "ChatGPT" era.  There's no getting around it. 

Specifically for this course on Statistical **Methods**---where we're building up a toolkit of techniques you can use in your research and other courses---ChatGPT represents in some ways a master tool, a way to very rapidly learn about new tools, or clarify confusion about one or the other, or generate code that helps you implement a new one.  Moreover, ChatGPT and related models will only get better as we move into the future, making them more and more powerful.  It's not hard to imagine a future, even within the next few years, where even highly technical work like research in the Earth Sciences becomes more than anything simply telling an LLM what you want it to do.

Setting that aside and returning to the present, for learning and teaching this presents a double-edged sword.  On the one hand, I encourage you to use ChatGPT in whatever capacity that is helpful to your **learning**.  In fact there will be some class time during the semester devoted specifically to teaching you how to use it effectively.  On the other hand, in this and other courses, having a tool that can churn out a decent essay, spit out the computer code, or solve the calculation you've been assigned, can be a serious crutch.  You simply will not learn the material if you just ask ChatGPT to do it for you.

For those reasons, I will permit and even encourage you to use ChatGPT in any assignments I give you.   And I'm not going to ask you to disclose if you used it, or if you worked with another student (which you're always free to do), etc.  (This does not apply to in-class exams, quizzes, etc. for which I will explicitly state that you are not to use it.)

If you use ChatGPT as a crutch, to get to the right answer but without thinking critically, and that leads you to get an "A", then to me, that's your loss.  Conversely, if you take a puritan stance and refuse to use this new generation of tools, which very much *are* the future, and that hinders your ability to keep up with your peers, then likewise that's your loss.  But if you approach ChatGPT and the course material with curiosity and respect, using it as a tool to help you connect with the material *even more deeply than you could otherwise*, then that's your gain and my gain.

Let's be excited about these powerful new tools, but let's be even more excited about growing your own intellectual capacity!
